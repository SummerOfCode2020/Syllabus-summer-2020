* VOCABULARY:
    - Parent Element: an HTML element is the “parent” of another element when it is directly outside that element and contains it with its opening and closing tags.

    - Child Element: an HTML element that is nested inside another element (the "parent" element).

    - Sibling Element: an HTML element is a “sibling” of another element when they share a parent element.

    - Metadata: “data about data” -- on an HTML document, metadata describes the document itself, rather than defining what the page should display in a browser.

    - Tag: the smallest building block of HTML. It always starts with a < symbol and ends with a >. Each HTML element is made up of 1-2 tags: either it has an opening and closing tag denoting the start and end of the element, or is “self-closing”, meaning it starts and ends in the same place.

    - Stylesheet: a separate file where styles are defined, which can be imported into an HTML file (or many HTML files!) to style the contents of that file.

    - href: Hypertext REFerence -- the html attribute defining a link to another file or webpage.

    - Hexadecimal Code: a color hexadecimal code is a six-digit code containing numbers 0-9 and/or letters A-F that corresponds to a color. These can be used in CSS to color HTML elements. A list of named CSS hex colors can be found here.

    - Pseudoselector: a type of CSS selector that is only applied when the selected element is in a certain state. For instance, the a:hover specifies styles we only want the link to have when the user is hovering her mouse over it.

* VOCABULARY: 

    - Data Type: in programming, a data type is the “kind” of data a value can represent. Common data types in Javascript are number, string, and boolean.

    - Integer: a number without a decimal point in it, such as 57. In some programming languages these are differentiated from decimal numbers, but in Javascript they are treated interchangeably.

    - Boolean: in programming, a data type that is always either true or false.

    - String: in programming, a data type that is a series of characters, used when we need to represent text.

    - Operator: in programming, operators are symbols used to perform specific operations on the values before and/or after them. Some operators represent common mathematical operations, like + and -, while others are specific to programming.

    - Function: a block of code with a name. Once we define a function, we can use it elsewhere by reference in other parts of the code.

    - Function Parameter: an “input” of a function. A function can have any (reasonable) number of parameters, even zero!

    - If Statement:
