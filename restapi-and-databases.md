### REST API

* REST: Stands for `Representational State Transfer`. It is a software architectural style focused on stateless and uniform communication of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations. 

* API: Stands for `Application Programing Interface`. An API powers the backend of an application.

* Vocabulary:
    - Middleware: In Express.js (and some other web frameworks), a function that helps process a request to the server. Each middleware receives the request and response object, does some operation, and then passes the request and response to the next middleware function in line.

    - Parse (request body): to take the data stored in the request body and transform it into a format that can easily interact with other code.

    - Frontend Development: Development relating to the client-side user interface of a software application. This interface is commonly in-browser, but can also be through a mobile or voice app, or anywhere a human interacts with a computer.

    - Backend Development: Development relating to the server side of an application. 
    Backend developers create systems containing business logic and persistent storage that communicate with frontend clients via APIs.

    - Full-Stack Development: Denotes development of both the frontend and backend of an application by the same person or team.

    - Dumb Components: also called presentational components because their only responsibility is to present something to the DOM

    - Actions: an app design pattern where the code responsible for reaching out to the API is separated into stand alone functions

    - `<base>`: an HTML element that specifies the base URL to use for all relative URLs in a document

    - Enzyme: a library that allows you to mount React components for testing purposes

    - Higher-Order Component: a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

    - Fragment: a React element that allows us to wrap sibling elements such that React treats them as a single element but we are not introducing an unneeded parent into our DOM

    - children: in React, a prop that is passed to an element which represents any elements that are nested inside of the element to which it is passed
